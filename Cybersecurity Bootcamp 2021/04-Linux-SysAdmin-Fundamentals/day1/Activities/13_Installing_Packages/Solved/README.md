## Solution Guide : Installing Packages

To install the packages `tripwire`, `chkrootkit`, `john`  and `lynis`, we need to use the command `apt` with the following syntax:
    
`sudo apt install <package>`

- Install Tripwire first, following the additional installation steps. 

  - Configure the mail system with "internet site."

  - When asked to select passphrases, and rebuild the configuration and policy files, select `YES`.

  - Create both site and local authentication keys (use `tripwire` for both).


Each time you install a package, `apt` will ask for permission to acquire the disk space needed to install the package.
  
- Use the man pages to find the flag that lets you automatically answer `yes` to any prompts that come up when installing a package:
    -  Run `man apt`

     - The flag is `sudo apt -y install <package name>`.

To install the remaining packages, run the following commands:

- `sudo apt -y install chkrootkit`

- `sudo apt -y install john` 
  
**Bonus**:

- Is there a way to install multiple packages with a single command?
    - Yes. Include each package name in the command, separated by a space: 
    
      `sudo apt -y install chkrootkit lynis john`
