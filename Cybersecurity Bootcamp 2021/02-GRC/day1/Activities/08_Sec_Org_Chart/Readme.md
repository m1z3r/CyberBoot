## Activity File: Designing a Security Organizational Chart

In the last activity, you began developing a plan for improving your GeldCorp's security culture. Now that you understand how security departments are organized, you can decide who to involve in the execution of your plan.

Before you can do that, you need to know who works for the company. In this activity, you'll use a description of the client company to build out their organization chart.

You'll use this org chart in the next activity to continue refining your security culture plan.

### Instructions 

1. Read the following description of GeldCorp, which you'll use to create your chart. 

    **Size**: 500 Employees

    **Description of Business**: GeldCorp is a financial technology firm that manages stock portfolios. Clients can use the web application to: transfer money from their bank to their GeldCorp fund, buy and sell stock, and research the market before making trades.

    **Description of Security Organization**: GeldCorp takes full responsibility for the security of its users and personnel. It manages the following concerns in-house:

    - Application security
    - Deployment and hardening of its own network infrastructure
    - Monitoring and incident response
    - Legal and regulatory compliance

2. Create your chart. 

    You can create an org chart by hand, or a free org chart creator online, such as [Formswift Organizational Chart](https://formswift.com/organizational-chart).

    If using Formswift: 

    - Select **Create My Document**.
  
    - Click **Start Here** to create the first position, which is typically the CEO.

    -  Continue building the org chart. 
    
- The org chart creator has several options when creating a position. While optional for this activity, you can choose a specific color to align with the name of the individual that holds the position. 
    
  - Colors can be helpful to illustrate several types of roles. For example, senior leaders can be red and department managers can be green.
    
- You can create more than one sub-role by selecting **Add** multiple times.

Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.
