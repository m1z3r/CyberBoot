## Solution Guide: Weighing Security and Business Objectives

### Business Plans

1. The director of engineering suggested giving all developers access to all data. 
  
    - **Pros**: Makes development easier. 
    
    - **Cons**: Allows _any_ developer to access _any_ user data, including sensitive PII that has nothing to do with their jobs. 
    
   **Recommendation**: The business should **reject** on grounds of privacy.

2. The director of IT suggested exposing administration servers to the public internet. 

    - **Pros:** Administrators can work from any computer. 
    
    - **Cons:** The servers would be publicly accessible, which is unacceptable for a private network. 
    
    **Recommendation**: The organization should **reject** this request. A VPN would be a better solution to this problem.

3. An SOC analyst recommended merging all of the company's mail servers into a single server, in order to cut costs and improve SOC efficiency. 

    - **Pros:** It would ultimately cost less and reduce the number of servers that attackers could potentially compromise, the number of machines that could expose vulnerabilities, and the number of machines that SOC has to monitor.

    - **Cons**: If the company has so many emails that it _needs_ to maintain multiple servers, this suggestion won't be possible.

     **Recommendation**: If the company doesn't have so many emails that multiple servers are necessary, hosting all of the data on a single machine is a good idea.
