## Activity File: Threat Modeling Step 5: Risk Analysis

In this activity, you’ll use the threats you identified previously to complete a quantitative risk assessment. 

- You must fill out a spreadsheet containing all of the risks you can identify, and use it to generate a risk matrix and heat map for GeldCorp.

Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.


### Instructions

Open the provided spreadsheet: 
- [Risk Template](RiskTemplate.xlsx)

If you do not have Microsoft Excel, please use Libre. 

- Note the following tabs:

  - **Risk Assessment Data**: Contains descriptions of each risk, as well as probability and impact ratings.

  - **Risk Matrix**: Matrix displaying how many risks of each severity level you’ve identified.
  
  - **Heat Map**: Chart displaying whether you should make-do, monitor, manage, or mitigate each risk.

  - **Risk Ratings**: Information on GeldCorp’s risk rating guidelines.

1. Use the threats you identified in the previous activity to fill in the most critical risks. 

   - Fill out the risk description, probability, and impact cells for each risk.

2. Next, consider less critical risks. Add at least five additional risks that are medium- or high-impact, but are not very likely.
 
3. When you have at least ten risks, click on the **Risk Matrix** tab. See at a glance how at risk GeldCorp is.

4. Click on the **Heat Map**. Scroll down and click the **Update Chart Data and Labels** button on the left. Answer the following questions:

    - Which risks should you mitigate?
      
    - Which risks should you manage?

    - Which risks should you monitor?

    - Do these results align with your expectations?
