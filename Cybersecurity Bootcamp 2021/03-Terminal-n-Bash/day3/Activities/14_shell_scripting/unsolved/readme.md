## Activity File: My First Shell Script   
  
- You continue in your role as security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager needs your assistance creating a simple shell script to automate the `awk` and `sed` tasks you completed today on your log file.

- This shell script can be provided to other security analysts so they can easily complete the same tasks you ran today.

- You are tasked with using `nano` to create a shell script with the `awk` and `sed` commands to analyze a log file.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/03-Terminal/student_day3/first_shell_script` folder in your Ubuntu VM:
  
 1.  Within this directory is a log file to analyze called `LogA.txt`. Use `nano` to create a script called `Log_analysis.sh`.
2. Within this script, place the `sed` command and `awk` command used in the previous activities to analyze the `LogA.txt` file.

    - **Note**: You can place your results in the same output files used in the previous activities.

3. Run the command to confirm the commands run as expected.
