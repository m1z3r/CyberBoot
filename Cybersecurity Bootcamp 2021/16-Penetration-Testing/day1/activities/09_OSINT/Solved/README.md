## Solution Guide: OSINT Recon
 
 The goal of this activity was to learn and understand how OSINT tools can be used against an organization in an attack.

1. Searching **site:megacorpone.com**, we can find the following information:

 ![Server Info](Images/GHACK_SEARCH_1.png)

  - www2.megacorpone.com provides server enumeration information.
 
    - The server name and version number of the web application can be used to identify existing vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
 
     - Attackers can use the domain name and port information during their network scans.
 
   ![Server Info](Images/GHACK_SERVER_INFO.png)
 
- www.megacorpone.com/about provides user enumerated information.
 
   - An attacker can use this information to formulate a social engineering campaign.
 
   - This can include spear phishing campaigns that establish trust and convey a sense of urgency with the target.
 
    ![User Info](Images/GHACK_USER_INFO.png)
 
 
On the bottom half of our search page is a large amount of information that we can use against this particular target.
 
- vpn.megacorpone.com > admin sends us to the company's VPN access portal.
 
   - An attacker can perform brute force attacks to gain access.

- siem.megacorpone.com/ossim/session/login.php sends us to the company's SIEM management system access portal.
 
   - An attacker can perform brute force attacks to gain access.

2. Using Shodan and the information acquired from Google dorking, find any other useful information that can be used in an attack.
  
   - Use the OSINT website osintframework.com and navigate to Domain Name > Whois Records > Domain Dossier.

     - Enter megacorpone.com into the search box and check all of the boxes. Click on **Go**.
 
     - In the **Domain Dossier** tab, observe the results and then scroll to **DNS Records**.
 
     - In this example, we'll use the mail.megacorpone.com domain and convert it into an IP using a tool of your choice. We'll use https://dnslookup.online here.
 
     - The DNS lookup returned an IP of `38.100.193.84`. We'll plug that IP into the Shodan website.
 
    - Below is an image of the Shodan website search results for our target.
  
    - We are presented with details about our target company that include:
  
      - Internet Service Provider
      - Web server and web application information
      - SSH key information
    
     ![Shodan 1](Images/SHODAN_IO.png)
 
 
    - A little further down the page is a list of vulnerabilities from a previous scan.
    
      - With this information, an attacker can exploit a variety of attack vectors, including:
    
        - Social engineering
        - Network scan information
        - Web server and application vulnerabilities based on software version and type

3. Now we need to exploit certificate transparency by looking for exposed domains.
 
    - Navigate to https://crt.sh and search sans.org in the search box. 
      
      ![CERT.SH Results](Images/CERT_SH_2.png)

     The search returns the following: 
  
    - The **Matching Identities** column exposes domain-related information that an attacker can use to perform various types of attacks, such as:
  
      - Domain hijacking
      - DNS flooding
      - Distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS)
  
4. What are two methods of mitigating the threat posed by certificate transparency?
  
    - Customers can opt out of having their certificates logged.
  
      - This is not the preferred method because it eliminates the benefits of transparency.

      - Additionally, malicious customers would prefer this option so they can obfuscate their crimes.
  
    - If available, have subdomain information redacted from certificate log entries.
